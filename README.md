#### Step by Step Tutorial on How to use Git and Github 
1. First, download the latest Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads. The latest version is 2.33. Once it is downloaded,\
   install it by double clicking on the file. 
2. Download the latest version of Webstorm from https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students. Follow the instructions\
   to get a free license. Once it installs, start it and create a new project.
3. Display the Webstorm setting underneath Files. Then, underneath Version Control,\
4. click on Git. 
5. To check if Git is connected to Webstorm, click on Test. \
6. The location box that is highlighted should read C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe. 
7. Once Git has been installed, there will be a message that confirms that "Git Executed Successfully." Then, click OK to exit settings.
8. Create a new project on the main page under Files. Choose a location for the file\
   and rename it to something meaningful before clicking on Create.
9. To create a workspace, go to Files --> New --> HTML File --> HTML5. This will open
   up a page for you to work in. Give the file index a meaningful name.
10. In HTML tags, make some changes that will be visible.
11. Then, click on VCS on the top bar --> Import into Version Control --> Create Git Repository
12. After clicking on OK, click on VCS again, then Git. When the pop-up box appears, click on\
    your newly created HTML file and commit the changes at the bottom right. 
 13. When doing this for the first time, there will be a dialog box that opens. Enter in your\
     Git username and password so that Webstorm will be connected to GitHub. 
 14. Add the project to GitHub by clicking on VCS, importing into Version Control and then sharing        project on Git Hub. 
 15. Clicking on Share will both commit and push your project to the Internet/GitHub. 
 16. Now to add a file from Github and connect it to Webstorm, add a new file to GitHub Repository\
     and then create a new file and call it README.MD
  17. Then make some changes to the file and commit them. You should be able to see hte file in your Repository. 
  18. Make some changes to your first HTML file in Webstorm and commit to Git through VCS --> Git--> Commit. You can comments to make your commit more descriptive. 
  19. Follow the same steps but this time to push the file to GitHub and off the local respo. 
  20. The system will find a the new file (README.MD) you created on GitHub. When it asks to Merge to Sychronize GitHub and your local machine, merge it.
  21. Now the README.MD file will be local and on WebStorm and the new changes you made to the original HTML file will be updated on GitHub. 
   







#### Glossary 
* __Branch__\
A branch is much like a repository on GitHub, but it is contained inside of it. You can save a project to a new branch outside of the main branch, much like a draft and then merge the branch to the main branch once you are ready to publish changes. 
* __Clone__\
When you clone a project on GitHub, you make an identical local copy of it so that you can make edits to it. 
* __Commit__\
Committing some changes to a projects essentially means that box up your work and save it. It doesn't make it public on the GitHub platform. 
* __Fetch__\
When you fetch a file, you are retrieving changes from the remote depository but not actually committing them to your local despo. It is used to compare changes you've made before saving it.
* __GIT__\
Git is an opensource software that is the basis for GitHub. It tracks changes in text files and is relatively easy to use. 
* __Github__\
GitHub is the online platform for managing Git. It connects people since it is an online server and can be accessed from anywhere as long as an account is made. 
* __Merge__\
To combine changes from one branch or fork in a repo, you merge to another branch to save it there. It is also called a pull request and it ntegrates into your local or remote repo. 
* __Merge Conflict__\
This conflict occurs when the program cannot understand what you are trying to commit either remotely or locally. When different people have worked on the same piece of a project and try to commit it, it will produce this error when we try to merge it to the main branch since it is not clear which changes to commit. 
* __Push__\
After committing and saving your project, you must push it to GitHub or the remote repository to be shared publicly. 
* __Pull__\
This command is the opposite of pushing something; you can retrieve a project from the remote repository and pull it into your local repo. This is mostly used when multiple people work on the same project and changes need to be updated in your local repo. 
* __Remote__\
Remote refers to the online server in which other people can view Git projects. This is utilised when more people work on the same project from different locations. The most common remote server used is GitHub.com
* __Repository__\
A repository acts as GitHub's project folder. You will save all your projects in repos and they can be made public or private to allow for collaboration. You can also review commit history made to a repository.
